# Repo rules — Pseudocore

Repo-specific rules and notes. The org-wide `AGENTS.md` beside this file is
maintained in [`neoforge-mod-template`](https://github.com/HexaHexes/neoforge-mod-template)
and pulled in verbatim - **never hand-edit it.** Everything in this file is this
repo's own and is edited freely; keep it aligned with the org rules rather than
restating them.

**Repo:** `HexaHexes/pseudocore` · **Mod ID:** `pseudocore` · **Branch:** `main`
**Platform:** Minecraft 1.21.1 / NeoForge 21.1.259 / JDK 21 · **Gradle:** 9.2.1 (wrapper committed)
**Jar:** `build/libs/pseudocore-<version>.jar`

Adds a single item - the **Pseudocore** - that captures any mob with all of its NBT,
holds it, and lets you carry/sell/trade it. Inspired by Ice and Fire's Dragon Horn but
generalized to any mob. **Runs standalone** - every mod integration is optional.

**Dependencies**
- Required: Minecraft, NeoForge, **Mob Info Common** (`mob_info_common`) - the
  shared variant-name and analysis-gating library this repo reads through the
  `org.bitwisemadness.mobinfocommon` packages; it ships as its own mod.
- Optional (each independently): Tensura (`tensura`) - EP tooltip + Tensura ownership
  fields; ManasCore (`manascore`) - supports Tensura; Ice and Fire CE (`iceandfire`) -
  Dragon Horn ownership mixin. Mobs of Mythology and Mysticism need no compile
  dependency here at all: their variant names moved into Mob Info Common.

**Test:** `./gradlew runGameTestServer` - GameTests for the Lightman's Currency trade
path and the tooltip gating (`TooltipGatingGameTests`). 22 `@GameTest` methods.
(Note: this repo uses `runGameTestServer`, not `runGametest`.)

**Remote:** `github.com/HexaHexes/pseudocore` (public, default branch `main`).

## Gotchas (do not regress them)

- **The variant logic lives in Mob Info Common now.** `VariantHelper` /
  `VariantBridge` / `SpeciesWords` and the Mythology/Mysticism access classes
  moved to the shared library; this repo calls them with its own
  `TensuraBridge::isLoaded` as the Tensura gate, so the `tensuraIntegration`
  switch still suppresses Tensura variant names. Do not copy logic back in.
- **The Tensura compile pin is 2.0.1.3** (`8793360`), the version Mob Info
  Common and Tensura Jade ship against. Bump deliberately, never implicitly.
- **`NOTICE.md` is mandatory and must never be deleted.** The horn's model silhouette
  and body texture are adapted from Ice and Fire / Ice and Fire CE and remain under
  **LGPL-2.1**; that third-party material is not covered by this mod's licence. Keep the
  full attribution and the list of modifications.
- **No icons.** The `icon/` listing-art folder and the in-game `META-INF/icon.png` have
  been removed per project convention - do not re-add them unless the user explicitly asks.
- Capture is guarded regardless of gamerule: only ownerless mobs or mobs you own; not
  leashed or carrying passengers. The boss/dragon blacklist lives in
  `config/pseudocore-server.toml`.
- Ownership-transfer gamerules (`pseudocoreOwnershipTransfer`,
  `pseudocoreDragonOwnershipTransfer`) both default to `false`.
- The Ice and Fire Dragon Horn ownership mixin is a separate, opt-in integration - if
  Ice and Fire CE is removed the mixin simply does not load.
- ManasCore's module jars nest under `META-INF/jars/` inside the core artifact and are
  extracted by `extractManascoreModules` for compilation.

## Scope doctrine - repo additions

- **Mixins are sanctioned here** as opt-in integrations (the Ice and Fire Dragon Horn
  ownership mixin loads only when Ice and Fire CE is present). They are not a general
  licence: the org rule "public API only, no mixins" still applies to new addon repos.

## Naming - this repo

- Repo and folder: `pseudocore`; `mod_id`: `pseudocore`; Java base package
  `org.bitwisemadness.pseudocore`, with the Maven `group` in `build.gradle` matching.

## CI & release model - this repo

- `ci.yml` runs the template's three checks (junit, gametest, version-bump).
- `release.yml` cuts the GitHub release for `v<mod_version>` on a push to `main`
  (pre-releases only when the repo variable `ALPHA_RELEASES` is true), and
  `publish.yml` publishes the Maven artifact to the org's GitHub Packages
  registry when that release is published - see the org rulebook for the
  consumer-side auth details (`PACKAGE_READ_TOKEN`).
